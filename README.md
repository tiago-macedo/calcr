# calcr
General calculator implementation in Ruby.

This was coded so I could learn Ruby, do not expect it to be functional/good/maintainable.

The idea is that it could parse expressions given by the user, printing the evaluated value.

## TODO

- [ ] Lexer
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Main loop with lexer and parser
- [ ] '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')'
- [ ]  '^', '%'
